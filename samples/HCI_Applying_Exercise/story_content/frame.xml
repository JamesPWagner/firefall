all-flash solution can achieve higher throughput than vsan because it’s a dedicated hardware. an all-flash solution has better deduplication and compression. with an all-flash solution compute and storage can scale up independently of each other. with an all-flash solution customers can use whichever hypervisor they prefer. vsan has 100k iops per node, which is enough for the vast majority of business applications. why pay more for a capability that is not needed. vsan has 59% lower tco than all-flash dedicated solutions.  scaling a dedicated storage solution is more expensive than adding more drives to a server or buying more x86 servers. 70%-80% of workloads already run on vsphere. additionally, with vsphere virtual volumes, vsphere is the only hypervisor that extends spbm to

centers located throughout jackson, clay, cass, and platte counties. employees: 3,600 endowment: $445 million software: horizon standard (100 desktops), which includes vsphere desktop and vcenter desktop initiatives: with limited budget, it is looking for solutions to a difficult vdi situation. their storage is overburdened by vdi workload, to the point that user login can take over 20 minutes and recomposing the vdi environment takes more than 10 hours.  fleming elevators locations: manufacturing plants at rolla (missouri, usa), mexico city, amsterdam, with 22 distributors and supply centers  employees: 10,000+ revenue: $1.1 billion annually software: vcloud suite standard (220 vms), which includes vsphere and vcenter server initiatives: it is looking for an infrastructure solution that is simpler and less expensive, but powerful. their highly-skilled storage personnel spend too much time in the day-to-day operations. now they are opening another manufacturing plant and they need to replace outdated infrastructure. they also have continuing concerns about security.  glendale sciences locations: headquartered in the city of glendale, california, glendale sciences has

been experiencing increasing complexity with the open source platform that the company is using, and costs have been growing as a result. they want to find a solution that will simplify their storage infrastructure without having to change from their existing platform.  brook warehousing locations: headquartered in van horn, texas, brook warehousing operates and administers 13 sites throughout the

evaluating all-flash and hyper-converged solutions for their main data center at their headquarters.    feedback: this is a very good upsell prospect, because horizon advanced and enterprise editions will provide them both additional vdi features and  hyper-converged infrastructure. they’re looking for something to resolve their infrastructure’s slow performance, one of the main pain points addressed by vmware hci. but another prospect on the list would represent a greater sales opportunity than this one.  feedback: this is the best prospect out of the four in the list. this customer has one of the most prominent storage infrastructure pain points: complexity. vsan definitely fits well as a solution to the customer’s challenge, meeting the need for simplicity and high performance. once vsan is implemented, it staff will no longer be required to have complex storage skillsets. it engineers will have more time to work on innovation and strategic projects. and vsan provides

addressing the security needs of their environment. begin meeting begin meeting begin meeting begin meeting begin meeting begin meeting  feedback: this might be a good opportunity for vmware hci, which would greatly simplify the complexity that this customer must be dealing with in their open-source platform. however, the customer would need to move everything over from their current platform to vmware hci, abandoning their current solution. although this sales play might lead to a very profitable deal, this company has expressed that they do not want to change their platform. therefore, another prospect on the list might represent a better opportunity.  feedback: this is a very good opportunity for vmware hci, because they already have vsphere/vcenter server and all they need is vsan to attain the benefits of hyper-converged infrastructure. however, with an annual revenue of only $48 million and only 21 vms, this prospect is at the lower end of the scale of vsphere deployments and is potentially used to cheaper, lower-end storage. as a result of being on this lower end, the customer would have to value the benefits of vsan enough to outweigh storage expense that may be greater than what they’re accustomed to. this higher expense creates more of a challenge for selling vsan to this customer.  please view the details for each of the four customers before selecting the best
